            Foobar2000 is a open source music player that was originated in 2002, yet has kept its moderninity. You can do nearly anything to it,
            including making your own things such as album browsers by coding in JavaScript. It is completely up to you how to style your music player.

            <p>Foobar2000 is really great. I hate Spotify and Apple Music, compared to foobar their UIs are extremely limiting.</p>

            <p>Foobar is for pirates who can't stand paying for music. It's morally horrible and I can't stand those music snobs.</p>
